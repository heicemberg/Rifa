# üö® CRITICAL: 2-TICKET DISCREPANCY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
User reports: **1900 vendidos + 8098 disponibles = 9998** (missing 2 tickets from required 10,000 total)

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

After comprehensive analysis of the database schema, application logic, and counting mechanisms, I have identified **THREE POTENTIAL SOURCES** of the 2-ticket discrepancy:

### 1. **DATABASE RECORD INTEGRITY ISSUE** (Most Likely)
**Location:** Supabase `tickets` table  
**Issue:** The database may be missing exactly 2 ticket records from the expected 10,000

**Evidence:**
- Schema shows tickets should be generated for numbers 1-10000
- Initial setup uses: `INSERT INTO tickets (number, ticket_code, status) SELECT num, generate_ticket_code(num), 'available' FROM generate_series(1, 10000) AS num;`
- If this initial insertion failed partially, some records may be missing

### 2. **STATUS MAPPING INCONSISTENCY** (Second Most Likely)
**Location:** Application counting logic vs database statuses  
**Issue:** Mismatch between database status values and application logic

**Evidence from code analysis:**
- Database schema uses: `'available', 'selected', 'reserved', 'sold'`
- Spanish version also uses: `'disponible', 'reservado', 'vendido'`
- Application logic in `useMasterCounters.ts` counts both English and Spanish versions
- Missing status values or incorrect mapping could cause 2 tickets to be uncounted

### 3. **FOMO CALCULATION INTERFERENCE** (Least Likely but Possible)
**Location:** `useMasterCounters.ts` and `useBasicCounters()`  
**Issue:** FOMO logic may be contaminating real mathematics

**Evidence:**
- FOMO adds 1200 fixed tickets to display
- Display calculation: `displayAvailableTickets = TOTAL_TICKETS - displaySoldTickets - data.reservedTickets`
- If this calculation affects the real counting, it could cause discrepancy

## üîç PRECISE SQL QUERIES FOR DIAGNOSIS

Run these queries **IN ORDER** in your Supabase SQL editor to identify the exact cause:

### Query 1: Verify Total Records
```sql
-- Should return exactly 10000
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM tickets;
```

### Query 2: Check for Missing Ticket Numbers
```sql
-- Should return empty (no missing numbers)
WITH expected_tickets AS (
  SELECT generate_series(1, 10000) as ticket_number
),
actual_tickets AS (
  SELECT number as ticket_number FROM tickets WHERE number IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  e.ticket_number as missing_ticket_number
FROM expected_tickets e
LEFT JOIN actual_tickets a ON e.ticket_number = a.ticket_number
WHERE a.ticket_number IS NULL
ORDER BY e.ticket_number
LIMIT 20;
```

### Query 3: Status Distribution Analysis
```sql
-- Mathematical verification
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND((COUNT(*)::decimal / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets)) * 100, 2) as percentage
FROM tickets 
GROUP BY status 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Query 4: Complete Math Check
```sql
-- This is the CRITICAL query - should total exactly 10000
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_tickets,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'available') as available,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('sold', 'vendido')) as sold,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('reserved', 'reservado')) as reserved,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'selected') as selected,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IS NULL) as null_status,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status NOT IN ('available', 'sold', 'vendido', 'reserved', 'reservado', 'selected') AND status IS NOT NULL) as unknown_status,
  -- Math check
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'available') + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('sold', 'vendido')) + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('reserved', 'reservado')) + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'selected') + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IS NULL) +
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status NOT IN ('available', 'sold', 'vendido', 'reserved', 'reservado', 'selected') AND status IS NOT NULL) as calculated_total
FROM tickets;
```

### Query 5: Find Data Integrity Issues
```sql
-- Check for various integrity problems
SELECT 
  'Duplicate ticket numbers' as issue,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT number) as count
FROM tickets
WHERE number IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'NULL ticket numbers' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tickets 
WHERE number IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Invalid ticket numbers' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tickets 
WHERE number < 1 OR number > 10000
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Tickets with empty status' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM tickets 
WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';
```

## üîß STEP-BY-STEP RESOLUTION

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Queries
Execute the 5 queries above and note the results. The issue will become clear.

### Step 2A: If Missing Records (Most Common)
If Query 1 shows less than 10000 records:
```sql
-- Insert missing ticket records
INSERT INTO tickets (number, ticket_code, status)
SELECT 
  num,
  LPAD(num::text, 4, '0'),
  'available'
FROM generate_series(1, 10000) AS num
WHERE num NOT IN (SELECT number FROM tickets WHERE number IS NOT NULL)
ORDER BY num;
```

### Step 2B: If Status Mapping Issues
If Query 3 shows unknown statuses:
```sql
-- Fix invalid statuses
UPDATE tickets 
SET status = 'available' 
WHERE status IS NULL OR status NOT IN ('available', 'sold', 'vendido', 'reserved', 'reservado', 'selected');
```

### Step 2C: If Duplicate Numbers
If Query 5 shows duplicates:
```sql
-- Remove duplicates (keep first occurrence)
DELETE FROM tickets t1
WHERE t1.id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(t2.id)
  FROM tickets t2
  WHERE t2.number = t1.number
);
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix
```sql
-- Final verification - should show exactly 10000
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_after_fix,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'available') as available,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('sold', 'vendido')) as sold,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('reserved', 'reservado')) as reserved,
  -- Math check
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'available') + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('sold', 'vendido')) + 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('reserved', 'reservado')) as math_total
FROM tickets;
```

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

After applying the fix:
- Total tickets: **10,000**
- Available + Sold + Reserved = **10,000** (exactly)
- User interface will show: **Sold + Available = 10,000** (no more missing tickets)

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

1. **Run Query 1** - This will immediately tell you if you have less than 10,000 records
2. **If total < 10,000**: Run the INSERT query from Step 2A
3. **If total = 10,000**: Run Queries 2-5 to find the specific issue
4. **Apply the appropriate fix** from Step 2B or 2C
5. **Verify with final query** from Step 3

## üîí PREVENTION

To prevent this issue from recurring:
1. Add a database constraint to ensure exactly 10,000 tickets
2. Add application-level validation to check math consistency
3. Set up monitoring alerts for ticket count discrepancies

---

**Execute these queries NOW and the 2-ticket discrepancy will be resolved definitively.**
